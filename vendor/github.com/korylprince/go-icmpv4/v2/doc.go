/*
Package icmpv4 provides functions similar to the standard library's net package for working with ICMPv4 generic packets.
See sub-package github.com/korylprince/go-icmpv4/v2/echo for an example of using this package to ping IPs.

Note that in most cases you will need to run the compiled binary with root/administrator privileges in order to send or receive ICMPv4 packets.
